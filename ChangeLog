	Version 1.0.5.

	Add aclocal.m4 file to git.
	This file is sort of generated, but at the moment only has
	a single line which includes m4/ocaml.m4, that is vital for
	the build.

	Re-add virt-top/README file.
	This seems to have been dropped during the hg->git transition.

	Document background noise of RX packets from bridges (RHBZ#647987).
	For more information see:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647987#c9

	man page: Remove excess blank line.

	main: Record and print full exception stack traces.
	This turns on stack trace recording unconditionally (the same
	effect as if OCAMLRUNPARAM=b was always supplied), and also prints
	stack traces to the log file if there is an exception.

	See also:
	http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Printexc.html

	Note that this requires OCaml >= 3.11.0.

	Fix pad function to work for negative widths (RHBZ#634435).
	The pad function is supposed to pad a string to a width.  Under some
	circumstances, the width parameter could be negative resulting in a
	call to String.sub such as:

	  String.sub str 0 (-1)

	which caused an exception to be thrown and not caught, causing
	virt-top to exit.  Fix the pad function to return an empty string if
	width <= 0 instead of throwing an exception.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=634435

	Update dependencies.

	Update generated man pages.

	Fix virt-top --end-time option when TZ<>UTC (RHBZ#637964).
	Return the end time as seconds since 1970, and don't adjust it
	for timezone.  In the main module the end time is compared against
	the result of Unix.gettimeofday, which is also seconds since 1970,
	so the comparison now works.

	Tested with TZ=UTC-05, TZ=UTC and TZ=UTC+05.

	NB: This has not been tested against ocaml-calendar 1.x, although
	that version of calendar is obsolete and no one should be using it.

	Update dependencies file.

	man page: memory option shows total guest memory (RHBZ#647991).

	man page: Update copyright date and link to web pages.

	Remove references to xm/xentop manual pages (RHBZ#648186).
	These Xen tools are obsolete since virsh/virt-top works across
	all hypervisors.

	Change order of return values from getyx - fixes display of historical CPU.
	In this commit:
	http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/ocaml-tmk/functions.c?root=ocaml-tmk&r1=1.2&r2=1.3
	Sam changed (fixed) the order that the coordinates are returned
	from the ncurses 'getyx' call.  Since this commit was made 3 years
	ago it should be safe to assume everyone is using the new ocaml-ncurses
	by now.

	This meant the historical %CPU was being displayed off the bottom of
	the screen instead of on the top row at the right.  Now it is displayed
	in the correct place.
