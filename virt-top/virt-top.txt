NAME
    virt-top - 'top'-like utility for virtualization stats

SUMMARY
    virt-top [-options]

DESCRIPTION
    virt-top is a top(1)-like utility for showing stats of virtualized
    domains. Many keys and command line options are the same as for ordinary
    *top*.

    It uses libvirt so it is capable of showing stats across a variety of
    different virtualization systems.

OPTIONS
    -1  Display physical CPUs by default (instead of domains). When virt-top
        is running, use the *1* key to toggle between physical CPUs and
        domains display.

    -2  Display network interfaces by default (instead of domains). When
        virt-top is running, use the *2* key to toggle between network
        interfaces and domains display.

    -3  Display block devices (virtual disks) by default (instead of
        domains). When virt-top is running, use the *3* key to toggle
        between block devices and domains display.

    -b  Batch mode. In this mode keypresses are ignored.

    -c uri or --connect uri
        Connect to URI given. The default is to connect to the Xen
        hypervisor.

        To connect to QEMU/KVM you would normally do *-c qemu:///system*

        To connect to libvirtd on a remote machine you would normally do *-c
        xen://host/*

        Full details on connection URIs is available at
        <http://libvirt.org/uri.html>

    -d delay
        Set the delay between screen updates in seconds. The default is 3.0
        seconds. You can change this while virt-top is running by pressing
        either *s* or *d* key.

    -n iterations
        Set the number of iterations to run. The default is to run
        continuously.

    -o sort
        Set the sort order to one of: cpu (sort by %CPU used), mem (sort by
        memory used), time (sort by total time), id (sort by domain ID),
        name (sort by domain name), netrx (sort by network received bytes),
        nettx (sort by network transmitted bytes), blockrdrq (sort by block
        device [disk] read requests), blockwrrq (sort by block device [disk]
        write requests).

        While virt-top is running you can change the sort order using keys
        *P* (cpu), *M* (memory), *T* (total time), *N* (domain ID), *F*
        (interactively select the sort field).

    -s  Secure mode. Currently this does nothing.

    --hist-cpu secs
        Set the time in seconds between updates of the historical %CPU at
        the top right of the display.

    --csv file.csv
        Write the statistics to file *file.csv*. First a header is written
        showing the statistics being recorded in each column, then one line
        is written for each screen update. The CSV file can be loaded
        directly by most spreadsheet programs.

        Currently the statistics which this records vary between releases of
        virt-top (but the column headers will stay the same, so you can use
        those to process the CSV file).

        Not every version of virt-top supports CSV output - it depends how
        the program was compiled (see *README* file in the source
        distribution for details).

        To save space you can compress your CSV files (if your shell
        supports this feature, eg. *bash*):

         virt-top --csv >(gzip -9 > output.csv.gz)

        You can use a similar trick to split the CSV file up. In this
        example the CSV file is split every 1000 lines into files called
        *output.csv.00*, *output.csv.01* etc.

         virt-top --csv >(split -d -l 1000 - output.csv.)

    --no-csv-cpu
        Disable domain CPU stats in CSV output.

    --no-csv-block
        Disable domain block device stats in CSV output.

    --no-csv-net
        Disable domain network interface stats in CSV output.

    --debug filename
        Send debug and error messages to *filename*. To send error messages
        to syslog you can do:

         virt-top --debug >(logger -t virt-top)

        See also REPORTING BUGS below.

    --init-file filename
        Read *filename* as the init file instead of the default which is
        *$HOME/.virt-toprc*. See also INIT FILE below.

    --no-init-file
        Do not read any init file.

    --script
        Script mode. There will be no user interface. This is most useful
        when used together with the *--csv* and *-n* options.

    --end-time time
        The program will exit at the *time* given.

        The time may be given in one of the following formats:

        *YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS*
            End time is the date and time given.

        *HH:MM:SS*
            End time is the time given, today.

        *+HH:MM:SS*
            End time is HH hours, MM minutes, SS seconds in the future
            (counted from the moment that program starts).

        *+secs*
            End time is *secs* seconds in the future.

        For example to run the program for 3 minutes you could do:

         virt-top --end-time +00:03:00

        or:

         virt-top --end-time +180

        Not every version of virt-top supports this option - it depends how
        the program was compiled (see *README* file in the source
        distribution for details).

    --help
        Display usage summary.

KEYS
    Note that keys are case sensitive. For example use upper-case *P* (shift
    P) to sort by %CPU. *^* before a key means a Ctrl key, so *^L* is Ctrl
    L.

    *space* or *^L*
        Updates the display.

    *q* Quits the program.

    *h* Displays help.

    *s* or *d*
        Change the delay between screen updates.

    *0* (number 0)
        Show the normal list of domains display.

    *1* (number 1)
        Toggle into showing physical CPUs. If pressed again toggles back to
        showing domains (the normal display).

    *2* Toggle into showing network interfaces. If pressed again toggles
        back to showing domains.

    *3* Toggle into showing block devices (virtual disks). If pressed again
        toggles back to showing domains.

    *P* Sort by %CPU.

    *M* Sort by memory.

    *T* Sort by total time.

    *N* Sort by domain ID.

    *F* Select the sort field interactively (there are other sort fields you
        can choose using this key).

    *W* This creates or overwrites the init file with the current settings.

        This key is disabled if *--no-init-file* was specified on the
        command line or if *overwrite-init-file false* is given in the init
        file.

INIT FILE
    When virt-top starts up, it reads initial settings from the file
    *.virt-toprc* in the user's home directory.

    The name of this file may be overridden using the *--init-file filename*
    command line option or may be disabled entirely using *--no-init-file*.

    The init file has a simple format. Blank lines and comments beginning
    with *#* are ignored. Everything else is a set of *key value* pairs,
    described below.

    display *task|pcpu|block|net*
        Sets the major display mode to one of *task* (tasks, the default),
        *pcpu* (physical CPUs), *block* (block devices), or *net* (network
        interfaces).

    delay *secs*
        Sets the delay between display updates in seconds.

    hist-cpu *secs*
        Sets the historical CPU delay in seconds.

    iterations *n*
        Sets the number of iterations to run before we exit. Setting this to
        *-1* means to run continuously.

    sort *cpu|mem|time|id|name|...*
        Sets the sort order. The option names are the same as for the
        command line *-o* option.

    connect *uri*
        Sets the default connection URI.

    debug *filename*
        Sets the default filename to use for debug and error messages.

    csv *filename*
        Enables CSV output to the named file.

    csv-cpu *true|false*
        Enable or disable domain CPU stats in CSV output.

    csv-block *true|false*
        Enable or disable domain block device stats in CSV output.

    csv-net *true|false*
        Enable or disable domain network interface stats in CSV output.

    batch *true|false*
        Sets batch mode.

    secure *true|false*
        Sets secure mode.

    script *true|false*
        Sets script mode.

    end-time *time*
        Set the time at which the program exits. See above for the time
        formats supported.

    overwrite-init-file *false*
        If set to *false* then the *W* key will not overwrite the init file.

    Note that in the current implementation, options specified in the init
    file override options specified on the command line. This is a bug and
    this behaviour may change in the future.
